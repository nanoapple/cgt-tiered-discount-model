# Data Directory

This directory holds generated synthetic data. **No real taxpayer or administrative data is included or required.**

## Files

- `ato_synthetic_family_groups.csv` — Generated by `R/generate_data.R`. Not tracked in git (see `.gitignore`). Run `source("run_all.R")` to regenerate.

## Data Strategy

- The synthetic data generator produces a realistic population using a 5-dimensional Gaussian copula with four investor archetypes (passive long-term, active accumulator, leveraged speculator, legacy holder).
- Large CSV files are excluded from version control to keep the repository lightweight.
- For reproducibility, the random seed is fixed at 2026 in `run_all.R`.
